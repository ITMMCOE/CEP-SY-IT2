## ⚙️ Initial Configuration

### First Run Setup
1. Click the extension icon
2. Configure settings:
   - ✅ **Enable Monitoring**: ON
   - 🎯 **Sensitivity**: Medium (recommended)
3. Click **"Train Baseline"** to establish your behavioral profile
   - Type naturally for 2-3 minutes
   - Move mouse normally
   - Extension learns your patterns

### Model Setup
The extension comes with pre-trained model thresholds from Altair AI:
- **Keystroke Model**: 70.5% accuracy (Generalized Linear Model)
- **Mouse Model**: 58.2% accuracy (Best Model from Altair AI Studio)

## 📊 Features Overview

### Real-Time Monitoring
- ⌨️ **Keystroke Dynamics**: Hold time, flight time, typing speed
- 🖱️ **Mouse Dynamics**: Speed, curvature, click patterns
- 🎯 **Anomaly Detection**: AI-powered pattern matching

### Security Levels
1. **Full Access** (Green)
   - Normal browsing
   - All features enabled

2. **Limited Access** (Orange)
   - Password fields blocked
   - Sensitive sites restricted
   - Banking/email protected

3. **Blocked** (Red)
   - Session terminated
   - All tabs closed
   - Browsing data cleared

### Security Alerts
When anomalies detected:
1. Browser freezes
2. Security alert modal appears
3. Choose response:
   - ✅ "Yes, it's me" → Full access restored
   - 👥 "Someone I know" → Limited access mode
   - ❌ "No, it's not me" → Block and terminate

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
**Error**: "Manifest file is missing or unreadable"
- **Fix**: Ensure `manifest.json` exists in extension folder
- Verify all files copied correctly

### No Behavioral Data Collected
**Issue**: Stats show 0 keystrokes/mouse events
- **Fix**: 
  - Refresh any open tabs
  - Extension needs page reload to inject content scripts
  - Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)

### Models Not Loading
**Error**: Anomaly detection not working
- **Fix**: 
  - Verify `models/keystroke-threshold.json` exists
  - Check `models/mouse-threshold.json` exists
  - Both models are already configured (keystroke 70.5%, mouse 58.2%)

### Permissions Issues
**Error**: Extension can't access pages
- **Fix**: 
  - Check manifest permissions granted
  - Re-install extension if needed
  - Some pages (chrome://) are restricted by design

## 📝 Model Updates

### Updating Keystroke Model
Your current model from Altair AI (70.5% accuracy):
1. Export model from Altair AI Studio
2. Convert to JSON threshold format
3. Replace `models/keystroke-threshold.json`
4. Reload extension

### Updating Mouse Model
Mouse model is already configured (58.2% accuracy, trained October 28, 2025):
1. Model exported from Altair AI Studio ✅
2. Thresholds extracted and configured ✅
3. `models/mouse-threshold.json` ready ✅
4. If you retrain with new data:
   ```json
   {
     "modelInfo": {
       "accuracy": <your_accuracy>,
       "trainingDate": "<date>"
     },
     "features": { ... }
   }
   ```
4. Reload extension
