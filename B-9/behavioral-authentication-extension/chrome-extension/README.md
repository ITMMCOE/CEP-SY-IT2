## 🎯 Overview

This Chrome extension provides **real-time behavioral authentication** using machine learning models trained on keystroke dynamics and mouse movement patterns. It continuously monitors user behavior and detects anomalies that may indicate unauthorized access.

### Key Features

✅ **Real-Time Monitoring**
- Keystroke dynamics (hold time, flight time, typing rhythm)
- Mouse movement patterns (speed, curvature, click behavior)
- Continuous background analysis

✅ **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**
- 70.5% accuracy Generalized Linear Model (keystroke)
- 58.2% accuracy Best Model (mouse - trained October 28, 2025)
- Adaptive baseline learning

✅ **3-Tier Security System**
- **Full Access**: Normal browsing for authenticated users
- **Limited Access**: Restricts passwords and sensitive sites
- **Blocked Access**: Terminates session and clears data

✅ **Encrypted Security Alerts**
- HTTPS-based encrypted notifications
- Email alerts with anomaly details
- User-controlled response options

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Load Extension** (Developer Mode):
   ```
   Chrome → Extensions → Load Unpacked → Select chrome-extension/ folder
   ```

2. **Train Baseline**:
   - Click extension icon
   - Press "Train Baseline"
   - Type and browse naturally for 2-3 minutes

3. **Enable Monitoring**:
   - Toggle "Enable Monitoring" → ON
   - Set sensitivity level (Medium recommended)

📖 **Full Installation Guide**: See [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md)

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Behavioral Capture
Content scripts track:
- **Keystrokes**: Timing between keydown/keyup events
- **Mouse**: Movement speed, distance, curvature
- Data buffered and sent to background every 5 seconds

### 2. Feature Extraction
Background service worker extracts:
- Average hold time
- Average flight time  
- Typing speed (WPM)
- Error rate
- Mouse speed/straightness
- Pause frequency

### 3. Anomaly Scoring
AI model compares current behavior to baseline:
- Z-score normalization
- Weighted feature scoring (60% keystroke, 40% mouse)
- Sigmoid confidence calculation
- Threshold: 65% = anomaly detected

### 4. Security Response
On anomaly detection:
1. **Freeze** browser (blur page, disable interactions)
2. **Alert** user with 3-button modal
3. **Apply** access level based on response:
   - "Yes, it's me" → Full access
   - "Someone I know" → Limited access
   - "No, it's not me" → Terminate session

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Basic Functionality Test

1. **Install & Load**:
   ```
   ✓ Extension appears in chrome://extensions/
   ✓ No errors in background console
   ✓ Icon visible in toolbar
   ```

2. **Popup UI Test**:
   ```
   ✓ Open popup → Shows stats
   ✓ Keystroke counter increments
   ✓ Mouse counter increments
   ✓ Confidence score updates
   ```

3. **Behavior Tracking Test**:
   ```
   ✓ Type on any webpage → Keystrokes captured
   ✓ Move mouse → Mouse events recorded
   ✓ Check background console for logs
   ```

### Security Flow Test

#### Test 1: Normal Usage (Full Access)
```
1. Browse normally
2. Observe green status in popup
3. No alerts triggered
Expected: Full access maintained
```

#### Test 2: Anomaly Detection (Limited Access)
```
1. Simulate unusual typing (very fast/slow)
2. Anomaly score crosses 65% threshold
3. Browser freezes + alert modal appears
4. Click "Someone I know"
Expected: Limited access mode activated
         Password fields blocked
         Sensitive sites redirected
```

#### Test 3: Session Termination (Blocked)
```
1. Trigger anomaly alert
2. Click "No, it's not me"
Expected: All tabs closed
         Browsing data cleared
         Session-ended page shown
         Email alert sent
```

## 🛠️ Configuration

### Sensitivity Levels
| Level | Threshold | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Low | 80%+ | Only critical anomalies trigger alerts |
| **Medium** | 65%+ | **Recommended** - Balanced detection |
| High | 50%+ | Very sensitive, may false-positive |

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Capturing Behavior
**Fix**: Refresh all tabs after installation (content scripts only inject on load)

### Anomaly Detection Too Sensitive
**Fix**: Increase sensitivity to "Low" in Settings or train longer baseline

### Models Not Loading
**Fix**: Verify `models/*.json` files exist and are valid JSON

### Security Alerts Not Appearing
**Fix**: Check `alert/security-alert.html` is web-accessible in manifest
