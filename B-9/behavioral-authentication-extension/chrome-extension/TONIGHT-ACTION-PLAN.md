## 🎤 DEMO SCRIPT (10 Minutes)

### **Introduction** (30 seconds)
> "Today I'm presenting a Behavior-Based Continuous Authentication system 
> built as a Chrome Extension. Unlike passwords that can be stolen, this 
> system continuously verifies your identity through how you type and move 
> your mouse."

### **Technical Overview** (1 minute)
> "I used Altair AI Studio to train two models: a keystroke dynamics model 
> with 70.5% accuracy and a mouse dynamics model with 58.2% accuracy. The 
> extension monitors your behavior in real-time and detects anomalies."

### **Live Demo** (5 minutes)
1. **Show Extension Popup** (1 min)
   - "Here's the live dashboard showing keystroke and mouse events captured"
   - Point to confidence score: "This shows how confident the system is"

2. **Normal Browsing** (1 min)
   - Browse a few sites
   - "Notice the stats updating in real-time"

3. **Trigger Anomaly** (2 min)
   - Type very slowly/oddly
   - "Watch what happens when suspicious behavior is detected"
   - Page freezes → Alert appears
   - "The system offers three options based on who might be using your computer"

4. **Show All Three Responses** (1 min)
   - "Yes, it's me" → Full access restored
   - "Someone I know" → Limited access with restrictions
   - "No, not me" → Session terminated for security

### **Q&A Preparation** (2 minutes)

**Q: How accurate is it?**
> "The keystroke model achieved 70.5% accuracy on 51 users - that's 36 times 
> better than random guessing. The mouse model achieved 58.2% on 65 users - 
> 38 times better. Together, they provide strong multi-modal authentication."

**Q: Can it be fooled?**
> "While no system is perfect, behavioral biometrics are very hard to replicate. 
> Your typing rhythm is as unique as a fingerprint. An attacker would need to 
> perfectly mimic timing patterns down to milliseconds."

**Q: Privacy concerns?**
> "All data is stored locally in Chrome. Nothing is sent to external servers. 
> The extension uses AES-256 encryption for any alerts, and users have complete 
> control over their data."

**Q: Real-world applications?**
> "This could prevent account takeovers in banking, protect corporate systems 
> from insider threats, or add a layer of security to shared computers without 
> requiring constant re-authentication."

**Q: What technologies did you use?**
> "Chrome Extension Manifest V3, Altair AI Studio for model training, JavaScript 
> for the extension logic, and I implemented real-time behavioral tracking with 
> AI-powered anomaly detection."
