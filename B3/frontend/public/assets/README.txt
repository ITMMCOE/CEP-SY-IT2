Static files published with the Vite app.

To show the logo on all hosting options, add the image here as:
  eisen-logo.png

The app refers to it at the absolute URL:
  /assets/eisen-logo.png

So the final path should be:
  frontend/public/assets/eisen-logo.png

Tip: Use a square PNG ~512x512 for best results.
